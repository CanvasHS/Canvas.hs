{- |
    The CanvasHS module allows haskell programmers to easily create graphical programs using event diven IO.    
    Using the installEventHandler function the user can register an event handler which will process incoming 
    events and with the current state in mind, will result in a new state and output, which could be graphical,
    actions (IO, timers and others) or both.
