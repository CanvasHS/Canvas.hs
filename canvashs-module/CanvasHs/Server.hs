    Starts the server, this starts a httpserver on 8000 which will serve the static content
    And will start the websocket server which will handle the trafic between canvasses and user haskell

    The function argument is the function to be called when receiving data over a websocket
    It should return data to be send back, or Nothing if there is no data to send to the canvas
    note that when Nothing is returned to only way to send data over the websocket is to wait for
    input from the websocket
